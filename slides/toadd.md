# To add

- Maybe add scales as a pattern
  - Not really a pattern though.
  - Much more a single way of correct positions
  - Better to this as a sidestep.
  
  
- For the path generator
  - We can use the arcs as example
  - But also use paths and curves
    - Maybe a better one, since it shows the complexity better.
    - Perhaps easier to explain in combination with the selection stuff.
